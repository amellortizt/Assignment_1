            <p>Developer<br><br>
                Centennial College - Programming 2<br><br>
                I developed this project during my second semester of studies. It involved creating a basic
                calculator that could switch to a scientific calculator by enabling or disabling specific buttons.
                In addition to performing calculations, it allowed users to change the calculator's color.
                The project also featured a tab called 'About me,' where more information about me could be found.
                It was a challenging project, but completing it brought me a great deal of happiness.</p>

                First semester 2023 <br><br>
                "This was one of my early projects in Web Interface Design. I was motivated to create it with a
                focus on sports and exercise because I remember during the pandemic, I decided to buy a bicycle
                to exercise and improve my diet. I had a very positive change, and I hope this project can inspire
                others to change their lifestyles and adopt healthier eating habits while incorporating regular
                exercise.</p>

            <h2>Project 3: Realtor page</h2>
            <p>Web Interface Design<br><br>
                This was my most recent project in Web Interface Design. I remember that I had just arrived in Canada,
                and
                finding rental property had been quite challenging. Our professor assigned us to create a webpage using
                an
                existing reference. Immediately, I thought of the Realtor who had been helping me find a property, who
                works
                for Royal LePage and is named Juan Carlos Robayo. He is an incredibly helpful person who provided me
                with a
                lot of guidance and assistance. I highly recommend him without reservation.
